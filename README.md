Predicting Air Quality in Dar-es-Salaam
This project revolves around analyzing openAfrica data to forecast air quality in Dar-es-Salaam. The primary objective is to construct a time series model that can predict PM 2.5 readings over the course of a day. The project places particular emphasis on comparing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of two distinct models: Linear Regression and AutoRegressive models.
