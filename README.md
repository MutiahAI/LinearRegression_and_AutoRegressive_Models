Predicting Air Quality in Dar-es-Salaam

This repository revolves around analyzing openAfrica data to forecast air quality in Dar-es-Salaam. The primary objective is to construct a time series model that can predict PM 2.5 readings over the course of a day. The project places particular emphasis on comparing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of two distinct models: Linear Regression and AutoRegressive models.

### Content:

- **Data:** The repository includes the Dar_es_Salaam.csv file, which contains the dataset used for air quality prediction.

- **Notebooks:**
  - **Linear_Regression_and_AR_models.ipynb:** This notebook contains code for predicting air quality in Dar-es-Salaam using Linear Regression and AutoRegressive models.
  
  - **ARMA_models.ipynb:** This notebook includes code for predicting air quality using an ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) model.

### Project Overview:

The purpose of this project is to leverage time series analysis to make predictions about air quality readings over the course of a day in Dar-es-Salaam based on historical data.
